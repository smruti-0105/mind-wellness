            <h3>How are diet and mental health linked?</h3>
            <p>The relationship between our diet and our mental health is complex. However, research shows a link
                between what we eat and how we feel.</p>
            <p>Eating well can help you feel better. You don’t have to make big changes to your diet, but see if you can
                try some of these tips:</p>
            <ul class="sub-heading">
                <li>Eat regularly. This can stop your blood sugar level from dropping, which can make you feel tired and
                    bad-tempered.</li>
                <li>Stay hydrated. Even mild dehydration can affect your mood, energy level, and ability to concentrate.
                </li>
                <li>Eat the right balance of fats. Your brain needs healthy fats to keep working well. Avoid trans fats
                    – often found in processed or packaged foods – as they can be bad for your mood and your heart
                    health.</li>
                <li>Include more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables in your diet. They contain the vitamins and
                    minerals your brain and body need to stay well.</li>
                <li>Include some protein with every meal. It contains an amino acid that your brain uses to help
                    regulate your mood.</li>
                <li>Look after your gut health. Your gut can reflect how you’re feeling: it can speed up or slow down if
                    you're stressed. Healthy food for your gut includes fruit, vegetables, beans, and probiotics.</li>
                <li>Be aware of how caffeine can affect your mood. It can cause sleep problems.</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>THE BRAINBOW</h2>
                <img src="../img/diet1.jpg" alt="Brainbow Diet">
                <p>The Brainbow diet is rich in all the colors of the rainbow and feeds the brain. Research suggests
                    that inflammation underlies depression; to counteract depression, we need to minimize inflammation.
                    We can do this by integrating a diet rich in colorful foods, spices, and herbs into our daily
                    practice. All the Brainbow foods represent different nutrients that quench the inflammatory fires
                    and nourish our neurons so they can communicate better. The idea behind it is that colorful
                    vegetables and fruit contain specific micronutrients that support your health and combat biological
                    stress with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory molecules.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="table-item">
                <h2>VEGGIES</h2>
                <img src="../img/diet4.jpg" alt="Vegetables">
                <p>Vegetables are abundant in dietary fiber, and because fiber has an anti-inflammatory impact, diets
                    high in fiber have been associated with a lower incidence of anxiety, stress, and depression.
                    Important fatty acids are omega-3s. Because of their potent anti-inflammatory properties, they
                    promote mental wellness and lessen anxiety symptoms. The researchers narrowed down the top fruits
                    and vegetables they found to be associated with better mental health and fewer symptoms of
                    depression. These include carrots, dark leafy greens such as spinach, lettuce, cucumber, apples,
                    bananas, grapefruit, and other citrus fruits.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="table-item">
                <h2>NUTRITIONAL FOOD</h2>
                <img src="../img/nutritional.jpg" alt="Nutritional Food">
                <p>Regularly choose foods that release energy slowly (rice, oats, wholegrain cereals and breads, and
                    seeds). Stay hydrated (water is best as it doesn't contain caffeine or sugars). Get enough
                    protein-rich foods (meat, fish, eggs, beans, pulses, dairy, nuts, seeds). Reduce/manage caffeine
                    (aim for no more than 2-3 cups of caffeinated drinks a day). Eat brain and heart healthy fats (oily
                    fish, eggs, lentils and beans, soya, nuts and seeds). Get your minimum of 5-a-day fruit and
                    vegetables (for those micronutrients and fiber).</p>

                <h2>MEDITATION & DIET</h2>
                <img src="../img/medyoga.png" alt="Meditation">
                <p>Meditation and diet are two essential components of a healthy lifestyle that significantly impact
                    both physical and mental well-being. While they might seem like separate practices, they are closely
                    related and can complement each other to enhance overall health.
                    Balanced Nutrition: Consuming a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients such as omega-3 fatty
                    acids, vitamins, and minerals helps improve brain function, enhancing mental clarity and focus
                    during meditation.
                    Avoiding Processed Foods: Foods high in sugar and processed ingredients can cause energy spikes and
                    crashes, making it difficult to maintain the focus required for effective meditation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="table-item">
                <h2>CAFFEINE</h2>
                <img src="../img/coffee.png" alt="Caffeine">
                <p>Caffeine is in tea, coffee, chocolate, cola, and other energy drinks. It is a stimulant. This means
                    it can give you a quick burst of energy. But it might also make you feel anxious and depressed,
                    disturb your sleep, especially if you have it just before bed, and give you withdrawal symptoms like
                    feeling irritable or depressed, if you suddenly stop having it. If you think caffeine is affecting
                    your mood, you could try to slowly reduce how much caffeine you have.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="table-item">
                <h2>BREAKFAST</h2>
                <img src="../img/breakfast.png" alt="Breakfast">
                <p>Avoid skipping breakfast. Breakfast is needed to fuel your body (including your brain) after going
                    without food during sleep and also jump starts your metabolism for the day. Skipping meals leads to
                    fatigue and feelings of brain fog. Try to incorporate a healthy breakfast into your routine. If
                    you’re tight on time in the mornings, grab a whole grain granola bar, yogurt, and a piece of fruit
                    to get you off to a good start.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="table-item">
                <h2>SAY NO TO DRUGS</h2>
                <img src="../img/no-drugs.png" alt="Say No to drugs">
                <p>The message to "say no to drugs" is a critical aspect of promoting health and well-being in
                    individuals and communities. Understanding the harmful effects of drug use and the benefits of
                    staying drug-free is essential for making informed choices and leading a healthy lifestyle.
                    Addiction:

                    Cycle of Dependency: Drugs can cause physical and psychological dependence, making it difficult to
                    stop using them once started.
                    Health Deterioration: Prolonged drug use can lead to severe health issues, including liver damage,
                    respiratory problems, and heart disease.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="table-item">
                <h2>LUNCH/DINNER</h2>
                <img src="../img/dinner.jpg" alt="Lunch/Dinner">
                <p>Avoid high-fat dairy, and fried, refined, and sugary foods, which have little nutritional value. In
                    addition to contributing to weight gain and conditions like diabetes, research shows that a diet
                    that consists primarily of these kinds of foods significantly increases the risk of depression. Try
                    to eat a diet that relies on fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, and unsaturated fats
                    (like olive oil). People who follow this kind of diet are up to 30% less likely to develop
                    depression than people who eat lots of meat and dairy products.</p>
